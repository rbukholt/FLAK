# FLAK - Decloudification Project

FLAK is an open-source initiative under the Prometheus Project, focused on reclaiming control of devices that are locked into cloud ecosystems. Many manufacturers tie their devices to cloud services, limiting user autonomy and compromising privacy. FLAK provides tools, guides, and solutions to decloudify these devices, making them local or private.

## 🚀 Mission

The goal of FLAK is to:

1. **Empower Users**: Provide the tools and knowledge to liberate devices from restrictive cloud systems.
2. **Enhance Privacy**: Ensure users retain control over their data by avoiding unnecessary cloud dependency.
3. **Promote Open-Source**: Share solutions and collaborate with the community to improve decloudification techniques.
